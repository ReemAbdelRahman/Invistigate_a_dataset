# Invistigate_a_dataset
Asking questions about a dataset and finding answers using data wrangling and exploration 

In this project, we will analyse a dataset for medical appointments. This dataset includes information about patients such as gender, type of illness, their neighborhood and whether they have received an SMS prior to their appointments. We will try to find out the factors that affect patients showing up for their scheduled appointmnets. In particular, we will try to answer the following quetions:

What is the percentage of patients showing up above and under 30 years?
Is there a relation between gender and showing up at the appointmnets?
Does sending an SMS affects showing up for the medical appointments?
Is there a relation between the type of disease and not showing up?
The dependent variable: No-show
The independent variables: Age, Neighbourhood, Scholarship, Hipertension, etc.
